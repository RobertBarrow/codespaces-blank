# Prioritisation Process Overview

When presenting a clear overview of the prioritisation process, it's essential to emphasise the importance of discovery, planning, and collaboration in determining our product roadmap. Here's a more detailed breakdown of how I would cover each of these in my presentation:

## 1. Discovery
   - Explain that the discovery phase involves understanding customer needs, market trends, and business objectives.
   - Highlight the significance of conducting user research, gathering customer feedback, and analysing market data to identify valuable opportunities.
   - Emphasise that discovery helps the team gain insights into user pain points, define problem statements, and uncover potential solutions.

## 2. Planning
   - Describe the planning phase as a critical step in translating the discoveries into actionable steps.
   - Discuss how planning involves defining Epic goals, setting clear objectives, and outlining key milestones.
   - Explain the importance of breaking down Epics into smaller, manageable User Stories, estimating the effort (including all appropriate roles and any additional resources required or costs incurred), and creating a dependancy map for execution.
   - Mention the involvement of cross-functional teams in the estimation and planning process to ensure a holistic approach and better alignment between different functions and capabilities.

## 3. Collaboration
   - Highlight the significance of collaboration throughout the product development cycle.
   - Explain that collaboration involves close communication and coordination between different roles and departments, including product managers, engineers, designers, and stakeholders.
   - Emphasise that involving stakeholders early on in the process allows for a better understanding of their needs and ensures their input is considered in decision-making.
   - Discuss the benefits of cross-functional collaboration, such as improved problem-solving, increased innovation, and better alignment between business goals and development efforts.

## 4. Determining the Roadmap
   - Connect the dots between the discovery, planning, and collaboration phases and how they contribute to determining the product roadmap.
   - Explain that the prioritisation process involves evaluating all available information, including customer insights, market analysis, and technical feasibility.
   - Discuss the criteria used to assess feature requests and how they align with the company's overall strategy and goals.
   - Stress the importance of making informed decisions based on data, user feedback, and the collective expertise of the team.

During my presentation, I would use visual aids, such as diagrams or slides, to illustrate the flow from discovery to planning to collaboration and roadmap determination. I would also encourage questions and open discussions to ensure everyone understands the process and its significance.
