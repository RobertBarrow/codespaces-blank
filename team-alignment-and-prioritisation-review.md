# Team Alignment and Prioritisation Review

## Attendees 

Ideally, the following individuals should attend the Team Alignment and Prioritisation Review:

### Development Team

This includes all the engineers, designers, and other team members involved in the product development process. Their presence is crucial as they are directly responsible for implementing and delivering the features.

### Product Manager(s)

The product manager(s) should attend the review to provide insights into the product vision, business goals, and strategic priorities. They can contribute to aligning the team's efforts with the overall product strategy.

### Technical Architects (or Engineering Leads)

Technical Architects and Engineering Leads play a vital role in providing technical guidance and expertise. Their presence ensures that the product portfolio's wider technical priorities, strategic roadmaps and other technical considerations are taken into account during the prioritisation review.

### Scrum Master

A scrum master or a suitable alternative (e.g. project manager) should be present to facilitate the discussion, ensure that the meeting stays on track, and help address any process-related issues or concerns.

### Stakeholders

Depending on the nature of the prioritisation review, it may be appropriate to invite key stakeholders who have a vested interest in the product. This could include representatives from marketing, sales, customer support, or other relevant departments. Their input can provide valuable insights and help align the team's priorities with business needs.
It is important to ensure that the right balance of perspectives and expertise is represented during the review. Having a diverse group of attendees promotes collaboration, facilitates discussion, and increases the likelihood of achieving alignment and consensus on the prioritisation decisions.

## Meeting Agenda: "Team Alignment and Prioritisation Review"

### 1. Welcome and Introduction
   - I would start the meeting by welcoming all participants and briefly outlining the purpose of the meeting.

### 2. Recap of Prioritisation Process
   - Provide a [clear overview of the prioritisation process](https://robertbarrow.github.io/primarybid/prioritisation-process-overview), reminding everyone of the key steps involved.
   - Highlight the importance of discovery, planning, and collaboration in determining the roadmap.

### 3. Current Prioritised List of Features
   - Share the existing prioritised list of features that the team has already scoped and planned for the quarter.
   - Discuss the rationale behind the prioritisation decisions made so far (including any scoring/ranking mechanism used).

### 4. Stakeholder Requests and Misalignment
   - Present the stakeholder requests that have caused misalignment with the established prioritisation track.
   - Explain the potential impact of these requests on the team's capacity, existing commitments, and timeline.

### 5. Team Discussion and Evaluation
   - Open the floor for discussion and allow team members to provide their insights and perspectives on the stakeholder requests.
   - Evaluate the feasibility and impact of accommodating these requests within the current prioritisation framework.
   - Discuss any potential risks, dependencies, or trade-offs associated with adjusting the priorities.

### 6. Reassessing Priorities and Adjustments
   - Based on the team's discussion, collaboratively reassess the prioritisation of features.
   - Make any necessary adjustments to the prioritised list, considering the team's capacity, stakeholders' requests, and strategic goals.

### 7. Communication and Process Improvements
   - Discuss any communication challenges or process gaps that led to the misalignment.
   - Brainstorm ideas for improving communication channels, establishing clearer guidelines, or enhancing stakeholder engagement in the future.

### 8. Action Plan and Next Steps
   - Summarise the revised prioritisation decisions and action steps resulting from the meeting.
   - Assign responsibilities for implementing the adjusted priorities and any necessary process improvements.
   - Set clear expectations and timelines for the next steps.

### 9. Closing Remarks
   - Wrap up the meeting by thanking everyone for their participation and emphasizing the importance of ongoing collaboration and adherence to the established process.

I would encourage active participation from all attendees to ensure a productive and collaborative meeting.
