title: "Technical PgM — Case Study Task"
---

## Background

As part of the hiring process for the PgM role at PrimaryBid, all candidates are required to do a
case study.  There is no “right” answer and all candidates will be scored on the same criteria.

## Process

1. Write a **[Plan and Approach](https://robertbarrow.github.io/primarybid/plan-and-approach)** documenting your thought process on how you would tackle
    the challenge as set out within the case study description.
2. Present your case study in a format chosen by yourself, making a case as to why your
    process best serves the related stakeholders.  Example Formats: PowerPoint, Word,
    Lucidcharts, and GoogleDocs are all acceptable formats, but please use whatever
    medium you feel is most effective.
3. Please choose a single Case Study from the two options below


## CASE STUDY #1

You find while working with a team of engineers within a company that has influential
stakeholders that all consider their requests priority 0.  They often skip the process and speak
directly to Senior Engineers and Product Managers in an attempt to influence the development
cycle directly.  In doing so they disregard the discovery and planning work required before these
conversations.

You have done the planning and prioritization for the quarter with the team and when you
compare the list of priorities with what they are pushing in the pipeline - You find the team is ill
equipped to be working on this due to poor defined communication channels, but the work has
already been scoped and shared with the team.

Please suggest a Product delivery approach (with roles and responsibilities) that you would
promote and implement as best practice and address the following questions.

1. How would you bring the team back to the right prioritization track, or adapt the prioritization track?
2. How would you make sure it does not happen again?
3. How would you communicate, and with who about the correct process of “requesting” new features and implementing more collaborative “Product-led” approach?
4. How would you educate the stakeholders and make them persistent in respecting the approach?

NOTE: Any facts that you are not finding in the text you are free to assume. Please do present
the assumptions as well.


## CASE STUDY #2

You are managing the delivery of _User facing apps_ products that imply significant collaboration
with internal application teams.  You are helping the team launch a completely new product and
in discussion with the Product manager you understand that both _User facing apps_ teams and
all the _Internal services_ teams have not planned/discussed the dependencies properly but the
backlog for _User facing apps_ team is planned and work is just about to start.  You flag this to the
Product Manager and the Engineering Manager.  Although now we run the risk that if we delay
the work further more the engineers will sit idle.

1. What is the short-term approach you would take?
2. Who is the main stakeholder you think would help you resolve the situation the quickest?
3. What kind of visuals would you suggest to try and clarify the situation quicker and explain the dependencies better?
4. What long-term approach would you suggest to help the teams assume their dependencies better?

NOTE: Any facts that you are not finding in the text you are free to assume. Please do present
the assumptions as well.
