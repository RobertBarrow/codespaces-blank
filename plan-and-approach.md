# Plan and Approach

To address the situation and establish a more effective product delivery approach, I would recommend the following steps:

## 1. Team Alignment and Prioritisation Review

- Schedule a [meeting with the team](https://robertbarrow.github.io/primarybid/team-alignment-and-prioritisation-review) to discuss the misalignment between the requested features and the established prioritisation track.
- Present a [clear overview of the prioritisation process](https://robertbarrow.github.io/primarybid/prioritisation-process-overview), emphasising the importance of discovery, planning, and collaboration in determining the roadmap.
- Revisit the prioritised list of features and evaluate the impact of the stakeholders' requests on the team's capacity and existing commitments.
- Collaboratively reassess the prioritisation based on the new information and make any necessary adjustments, involving the team's input and expertise.

## 2. Enhance Communication Channels

- Establish clear communication channels and guidelines for stakeholders to submit feature requests or express their concerns.
- Designate a single point of contact or a dedicated channel for handling incoming feature requests and enquiries from stakeholders.
- Ensure that all stakeholders are aware of these communication channels and are encouraged to follow the established process.

## 3. Reinforce the Product-Led Approach

- Organise workshops or training sessions for both the development team and stakeholders to educate them about the benefits of a product-led approach.
- Highlight the significance of thorough discovery and planning phases in achieving successful product outcomes.
- Emphasise the importance of collaboration, including involving stakeholders early in the process and gathering their input during discovery and planning stages.

## 4. Clear Roles and Responsibilities

- Define and communicate clear roles and responsibilities within the product delivery process.
- Clearly outline the responsibilities of senior engineers and product managers, emphasising their roles in supporting the team and adhering to the established process.
- Encourage senior engineers and product managers to redirect stakeholders to the proper channels and ensure they follow the established process.

## 5. Stakeholder Education and Consistent Reinforcement

- Personally engage with influential stakeholders and have one-on-one conversations to explain the correct process for requesting new features.
- Emphasise the benefits of following the established process, such as better resource allocation, improved product quality, and increased stakeholder satisfaction.
- Share success stories from previous projects where the product-led approach led to positive outcomes and customer satisfaction.
- Continuously reinforce the importance of the established process through regular communication, updates, and periodic reviews.

## 6. Continuous Improvement

- Regularly evaluate and review the effectiveness of the implemented product delivery approach.
- Collect feedback from the team, stakeholders, and customers to identify areas for improvement.
- Actively seek opportunities to enhance communication, streamline processes, and strengthen collaboration within the team and with stakeholders.

# Conclusion 

By implementing these steps, you can bring the team back to the right prioritisation track, ensure adherence to the established process, and foster a more collaborative and effective product delivery approach.
